- What are your initial impressions of Java?
    They are many sytax rules to follow. For example, I need to define the class, objects and functions upfront. 
    Logic and steps are important becuase they help break the pragram into manageable parts to code. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?
    Procedural logic and basic structures, such as if/else statements, for loops, and main methods. However, there's more emphasis on methods in Java, reflecting its object-oriented nature. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I understood the expectations of the chatbot, but sometimes there was a gap between what I wanted and the what was returned. 
    My advice would be to start early and aim small. 
    Think about what you want to implement and write down pseudocode to help with the logic. 
    Then, fix the code step by step.
